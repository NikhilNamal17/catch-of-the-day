## What is it?
This is a project built along following the  [React For Beginners](https://reactforbeginners.com/) course by Wes Bos. 
The styling for the course is completely provided, only the JS was made by me, [see starter files](https://github.com/wesbos/React-For-Beginners-Starter-Files). I will be going beyond this course by styling things and making the site responsive.
