A single page react app for fresh seafood market.
<hr>

This is a react based single page web app for sale of fresh caught seafood online. 
I used Firebase as the database and Oauth sign-up.



###
The App has three main sections which include display of available fishes, order component and inventory component.
A user can add any order to the order-list.

###
The inventory can only be handled by owner and can be manipulated. The owner is the very first user who signup for a specific store.
I've used a random store generator located in helper.js

## To develop
clone the repo and npm install

## To Build
npm run build
